  abstract    = {Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to the slowing of responses to a target that appears in the same location as a previous event. Many researchers have speculated that \{IOR\} arises from inhibitory neural processes that have developed through evolution to facilitate efficient search patterns by biasing the action and/or attention of an individual towards novel locations. Throughout evolution, however, humans conducted searches as individuals as well as members of a group. In this context, we sought to determine if \{IOR\} could also be observed in the behavior of one individual after the observation of another's behavior. Consistent with our reasoning, there was no difference in the magnitude of the \{IOR\} effect found when participants followed their own response or the response of their partner. These results are discussed in the context of action-based attention and possible underlying neural mechanisms.},

  abstract    = {Responses to a target stimulus can be slower when it appears in the same rather than a different location to a previous event, an effect known as inhibition of return (IOR). Recently, it has been shown that when two people alternate responses to a target, one person’s responses are slower when they are directed to the same locations as their partner’s previous response. The present study sought to investigate this highly novel effect, which we term social \{IOR\} (SIOR), in relation to what is known of \{IOR\} in individuals performing alone. We found that only a real conspecific can induce \{SIOR\} in another person, whereas an animated conspecific cannot. Additionally, \{SIOR\} emerges at locations to which a conspecific has been inferred to respond, even when direct observation of his/her responses is prevented. Finally, \{SIOR\} can be induced without the abrupt visual transients normally associated with the generation of IOR. These findings suggest that \{SIOR\} is the result of stronger activations of \{IOR\} mechanisms, or that it is subserved by entirely separate inhibitory processes.},

  abstract    = {Objective: To investigate whether virtual humans produce social facilitation effects. Background: When people do an easy task and another person is nearby, they tend to do that task better than when they are alone. Conversely, when people do a hard task and another person is nearby, they tend to do that task less well than when they are alone. This phenomenon is referred to in the social psychology literature as social facilitation. The present study investigated whether virtual humans can evoke a social facilitation response. Method: Participants were given different tasks to do that varied in difficulty. The tasks involved anagrams, mazes, and modular arithmetic. They did the tasks alone, in the company of another person, or in the company of a virtual human on a computer screen. Results: For easy tasks, performance in the virtual human condition was better than in the alone condition, and for difficult tasks, performance in the virtual human condition was worse than in the alone condition. Conclusion: As with a human, virtual humans can produce social facilitation. Application: The results suggest that designers of virtual humans should be mindful about the social nature of virtual humans; a design decision as to when and how to present a virtual human should be a deliberate and informed decision. An ever-present virtual human might make learning and performance difficult for challenging tasks.},

  abstract    = {What effect does controlling an avatar, while in the presence of other virtual agents, have on task performance in virtual worlds? Would the type of view have an influence on this effect? We conducted a study to observe the effects of social inhibition/facilitation traditionally seen in human-to-human interaction. The theory of social inhibition/facilitation states that the presence of others causes people to perform worse on complex tasks and better on simple tasks. Simple tasks are well-learned, easy tasks, while complex tasks require more thought processes to complete the task.  Participants interacted in a virtual world through control of an avatar. Using this avatar, they completed both simple and complex math tasks in both 1st person and 3rd person views, either in the presence of another female virtual agent, male agent, or alone. The results from this study show that gender of virtual agents has an effect on real humans’ sense of presence in the virtual world. Trends exist for inhibition and facilitation based on the gender of the agent and the view type. We have also identified several challenges in conducting experimental studies in virtual worlds. Our results may have implications on designing for education and training purposes in virtual worlds.},

  abstract    = {Previous research has revealed that the inhibition of return (IOR) effect emerges when individuals respond to a target at the same location as their own previous response or the previous response of a co-actor. The latter social IOR effect is thought to occur because the observation of co-actor's response evokes a representation of that action in the observer and that the observation-evoked response code subsequently activates the inhibitory mechanisms underlying IOR. The present study was conducted to determine if knowledge of the co-actor's response alone is sufficient to evoke social IOR. Pairs of participants completed responses to targets that appeared at different button locations. Button contact generated location-contingent auditory stimuli (high and low tones in Experiment 1 and colour words in Experiment 2). In the Full condition, the observer saw the response and heard the auditory stimuli. In the Auditory Only condition, the observer did not see the co-actor's response, but heard the auditory stimuli generated via button contact to indicate response endpoint. It was found that, although significant individual and social IOR effects emerged in the Full conditions, there were no social IOR effects in the Auditory Only conditions. These findings suggest that knowledge of the co-actor's response alone via auditory information is not sufficient to activate the inhibitory processes leading to IOR. The activation of the mechanisms that lead to social IOR seems to be dependent on processing channels that code the spatial characteristics of action.},

  abstract    = {When two individuals alternate reaching responses to visual targets presented on a shared workspace, one individual is slower to respond to targets occupying the same position as their partner’s previous response. This phenomenon is thought to be due to processes that inhibit the initiation of a movement to a location recently acted upon. However, two distinct forms of the inhibition account have been posited, one based on inhibition of an action, the other based on inhibition of an action and location. Furthermore, an additional recent explanation suggests the phenomenon is due to mechanisms that give rise to action congruency effects. Thus the three different theories differ in the degree to which action co-representation plays a role in the effect. The aim of the present work was to examine these competing accounts. Three experiments demonstrated that when identical actions are made, the effect is modulated by the configuration of the visual stimuli acted upon and the perceptual demands of the task. In addition, when the co-actors perform different actions to the same target, the effect is still observed. These findings support the hypothesis that this particular joint action phenomenon is generated via social cues that induce location-based inhibition of return rather than being due to shared motor co-representations. •We test conditions when inhibition of return following the action of another is observed.•Inhibition depends upon the visual organization of the response environment.•Inhibition was unaffected by performing an identical action to another.•Inhibition was correlated with reaction time in an individual cueing task.},

It is a well-documented fact that IOR is not restricted to previously attended locations, but rather has a spatial gradient. Based on a myriad of manual/saccadic dissociations, many researchers now believe that there are at least two forms of IOR completely dissociable on the basis of response type. The present study evaluated whether these two forms of IOR are encoded in similar representations of space. Across a range of conditions, there was little indication that the two forms could be differentiated on the basis of their spatial distributions. Furthermore, the present study also found that the gradient of IOR was steepest for cues appearing nearest fixation.},

Using a variant of an action observation paradigm, four experiments examined whether one person’s behaviour can influence the subjective decisions and judgements of another. In Experiment 1, two observers sat adjacent to each other and took turns to freely select and reach to one of two locations. Results showed that participants were less likely to make a response to the same location as their partner. In three further experiments observers were asked to decide which of two familiar products they preferred or which of two faces were most attractive. Results showed that participants were less likely to choose the product or face occupying the location of their partner’s previous reaching response. These findings suggest that action observation can influence a range of free choice preferences and decisions. Possible mechanisms through which this influence occurs are discussed.},

Consistent with the suggestion that the mirror neuron system may be responsible for activating the inhibitory mechanisms behind IOR on observation trials, between-person IOR was only detected under restricted viewing conditions known to activate mirror neurons.

This period is followed by one in which processing is impaired, rather than facilitated. This impairment has been termed inhibition of return (IOR). In the present study, the time course of this phenomenon was examined in two ways. (1) A graphical metaanalysis plotted the size of the effect as a function of the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of the two stimuli. This analysis showed that IOR is impressively stable for SOAs of 300-1,600 msec. It also showed that the literature does not provide any clear sense of the duration of IOR. (2) An empirical approach was, therefore, taken to fill this gap in our knowledge of IOR. In three experiments, IOR was tested using SOAs between 600 and 4,200 msec. IOR was robust for approximately 3 sec and appeared to taper off after this point; the observed duration varied somewhat as a function of the testing conditions. In addition, for the first second, the degree of inhibition was inversely related to distance of the target from the original stimulus, but for the next 2 sec this spatial distribution was not observed. Theories of the mechanisms and function of IOR must conform to these spatial and temporal properties.},

Cohen (1980, 1984). The effect takes the form of an inability to respond quickly to a stimulus appearing in the same location in the visual periphery as a previous one that produced covert orienting. Several characteristics of the effect were revealed that eliminate possible explanations in terms of response inhibition, masking, and sensory habituation. Results show that the inhibitory component of orienting occurred whether or not the 1st stimulus required a response, lasted at least a second, affected not only the originally stimulated location but also nearby locations, was determined by environmental coordinates, and occurred both in the periphery and at the fovea. It is concluded that inhibition may act together with an early facilitatory component in directing the attention and eye movement systems to maintain efficient spatial sampling.},

  abstract    = {Social inhibition of return is the phenomenon whereby an individual is slower to reach to locations to which another individual has recently responded. Although this suggests that an observer represents another person’s action, little is known about which aspects of the action are encoded. The present work describes a series of three experiments examining whether social inhibition of return represents the endpoint goal of the action, i.e., is ‘goal based’. Pairs of participants sat opposite to one another and alternated responses to a cued or non-cued object presented on a table top. Importantly, either the two participants performed the same interaction with the object or a different interaction. Although all our experiments showed social inhibition of return, the size of the effect was not modulated according to whether each participant had the same or different goal. We conclude that although the mechanisms giving rise to social inhibition of return do encode some aspects of a response they do not code for terminal action goals.},

It has been suggested that these social influences occur because the observation of action evokes a representation of that response in the observer and that these codes are subsequently accessed by other cognitive systems to modify future behaviour. In the case of social search and movement tasks, the observation-evoked response code is thought to activate the same mechanisms that are activated following internally-generated response codes. In support of this hypothesis, the present study revealed that the magnitudes of the between-person inhibition of return (IOR) effects were correlated with within-person IOR effects. These findings provide substantial support for the link between observation-evoked response codes and social cognitive effects.},

Although both tasks have been used to examine the processes and characteristics of IOR, few studies have been conducted to understand if there are any differences in the processes that underlie the IOR that results from ignoring (CT paradigm) or responding to (TT paradigm) the first stimulus. The purpose of the present study was to examine the notion that IOR found in TT tasks represents ``true'' IOR whereas IOR found in CT tasks consist of both ``true'' IOR and response inhibition (Coward et al. in Exp Brain Res 155:124--128, 2004). Consistent with the pattern of effects found by Coward et al. (Exp Brain Res 155:124--128, 2004), IOR was larger in the CT task than in the TT task when a single detection response was required (Experiment 1). However, when participants completed one of two spatially-directed responses (rapid aiming movement to the location of the target stimulus), IOR effects from the CT and TT tasks were equal in magnitude (Experiment 2). Rather than CT tasks having an additional response inhibition component, these results suggest that TT tasks may show less of an inhibitory effect because of a facilitatory response repetition effect.},

  abstract    = {It has been proposed that the deficits in social interaction seen in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) arise from problems in action perception stemming from a dysfunction of the mirror neuron system (MNS) — a neural network that becomes active during the performance and observation of action. A dysfunction of this system could have a cascading effect leading to deficits in social cognition because poor activation of the MNS during action observation may lead to an incomplete understanding of another person's actions, intentions and, ultimately, mental states. The present study tested the MNS dysfunction explanation by determining if people with ASD demonstrate a between-person inhibition of return (BP-IOR) effect. The BP-IOR effect, longer reaction times to targets presented at the location of another person's previous response relative to an unresponded-to location, has been hypothesized to be the result of the MNS co-representing the observed response and subsequently activating the mechanisms that cause IOR when individuals respond on their own (within-person IOR [WP-IOR]). Consistent with the MNS dysfunction hypothesis, participants with ASD did not demonstrate a BP-IOR effect in a condition in which they only observed the movement of the partner. The participants with ASD did demonstrate a WP-IOR effect suggesting that the mechanisms underlying IOR are intact in ASD. The contrast between the BP- and WP-IOR effects in the participants with ASD provides significant behavioural evidence for MNS dysfunction in ASD and has important implications for understanding this disorder.},

  abstract    = {Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to the finding that longer reaction times (RTs) are observed for movements made to the same location as a previous event/response (Posner & Cohen, 1984). IOR has been shown to occur both when participants perform the task on their own (individual-IOR) and in joint action contexts (social-IOR) (Welsh et al., 2005). Typical social-IOR paradigms involve participants moving to targets to the left or right of a home position. Target locations are indicated by the onset of a visual stimulus and pairs of individuals take turns responding to the illuminated location. The longer RTs to targets presented at the same location as the partner’s previous response is characteristic of IOR and, as such, social-IOR has been suggested to be caused by an inhibitory mechanism enacted to bias visual search to new locations. In the present study, we sought to determine if the partner’s responses also bias the individual’s response selection. Pairs of participants (n=16) completed two social movement tasks in which they alternatively moved to one of two locations. In the forced-choice task, the onset of a light indicated the target for the trial. In the free-choice task, there was no light stimulus and participants were free to choose to move to either location. The analysis of the forced-choice task revealed that RTs for different targets were significantly shorter than those for repeated targets (social-IOR). Although there were no RT differences in the free-choice task, participants were significantly less likely to move to the same location that their partner just moved to (i.e., they were more likely to move to the opposite location). These results suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms underlying social-IOR can bias response selection and suggest that social-IOR is not due to attentional biases induced by peripheral visual events.},

Although an abundance of work has examined the many characteristics of this phenomenon it is not yet known why the effect occurs. In particular, some authors have argued that action representation mechanisms are central to the effect. However, here we present evidence in support of an account in which the representation of action is not necessary. First, the basic effect occurs even when participants cannot see their co-actor's movement but, importantly, have their attention shifted to a target side via an attentional cue. Second, its time course is too short-lasting to function effectively as a component of action planning. Finally, unlike other joint action phenomena, the effect is not modulated by higher order mechanisms concerned with the personal attributes of a co-actor. Taken together, these results suggest that this particular joint action phenomenon is due to attentional rather than action mechanisms.},

  abstract    = {During joint actions, individuals coordinate their movements in space and time to achieve common goals. It has been suggested that action co-representation, a process in which co-actors represent each other’s responses, facilitates joint action. One of the methods used to explore action co-representation, the Joint Simon (JS) task, has revealed that when pairs of individuals sit next to each other, participants’ response times to targets presented in front of them are shorter than response times to targets presented in front of their partner. The action co-representation account of this effect holds that it emerges due to facilitatory and inhibitory processes that occur as a consequence of the representation of a co-actor’s response. Guagnano et al. (2010), however, have argued against the action co-representation account, having observed that participants sitting in each other’s extrapersonal space did not exhibit a JS effect in a JS task modified to reduce its social nature. Based on this null result, Guagnano et al. suggested that typical JS effects emerge due to a heightened social context and the spatial proximity of participants. To test and expand this alternative account, we conducted a series of experiments designed to map the spatial coordinates of the JS effect. The only consistent findings in these experiments, however, were JS effects when co-actors performed the task in extrapersonal space. Due to the contrast between our results and those observed by Guagnano et al., we attempted to replicate the key null effect using Guagnano et al.’s adapted version of the JS task. We found a significant JS effect in the extrapersonal space condition. Considering these studies together, we suggest that Guagnano et al.’s null effect was an anomaly and reassert that action co-representation is the process underlying JS effects.},

Here, we report the results of two 3--D reflexive cuing studies in which depth was defined by binocular disparity. As has been shown before, attentional cuing was specific for x--y--z locations. However, the present results show that IOR is not depth specific. After a specific location in x--y--z is cued, IOR occurs for the depth plane in front of and behind the cued location. The finding that IOR spreads across depth planes may be related to how inhibited locations are encoded in the superior colliculus. We argue that the functional role of a depth--blind IOR is to bias attention against going back to any part of a previously attended object.},

However, recent evidence has shown that the most prominent of these joint-action effects (i.e., the Social Simon effect), can occur when no co-actor is present. In the current work we examined whether another joint-action phenomenon (a movement congruency effect) can be induced when a participant performs their part of the task with a different effector to that of their co-actor and when a co-actor's action is replaced by an attention-capturing luminance signal. Contrary to what is predicted by the action co-representation account, results show that the basic movement congruency effect occurred in both situations. These findings challenge the action co-representation account of this particular effect and suggest instead that it is driven by bottom-up mechanisms.},

Specifically, watching another person perform a goal-directed aiming movement engages similar inhibitory processes on a subsequent aiming attempt as if having performed the preceding movement oneself. This between-person effect has been attributed to the mirror neuron system. In the study reported here, we replicated this finding and examined the relative importance of automatic stimulus alerting events and action–observation by dissociating these two influences. This was done by having two people alternately perform sets of two aiming trials to the same equally probable targets. Under some experimental conditions, one or both of the performers moved to a non-illuminated target. In this way, we dissociated the stimulus and observed event under some between-person conditions. Although IOR was greatest when the stimulus and observed events were compatible, both contributed to the between-person inhibitory processes slowing the responses (Experiment 1). The impact of observing another person perform an aiming movement appears to have more to do with realizing a particular spatial goal than seeing the biological motion associated with achieving that goal (Experiment 2). Findings that both the illumination of a visual target signal and the observation of another person’s action engage similar attention–action processes are consistent with action-based accounts of visual selective attention.},

(2001) compared the positron emission tomography (PET) responses of participants who observed a real hand grasping a geometric object, compared to the same hand rendered in 3D virtual reality or in 2D movie sequences. Results showed that the way in which the actions were rendered had marked effects on the brain areas that responded. Only the real hand activated visuospatial regions such as the right inferior parietal cortex, which is known to be involved in motor planning (e.g., Decety, 1996). Real and virtually real actions also activated inferior temporal regions that are associated with perceptual representations of actions (Decety et al., 1997), whereas the 2D movie sequences did not. More recently, Mar, Kelley, Heatherton, and Macrae (2007) found that while live-action and computer animated images commonly activated temporal cortical regions, overall activation was stronger for live-action images. Hence, it is possible that SIOR is the product of different inhibitory mechanisms that respond to real rather than animated events, or that it results from stronger activation of the same mechanisms.},

  abstract    = {Inhibition of return (IOR) is the phenomenon whereby people are slower to respond to previously attended to targets or locations. Prior research demonstrated this with individuals acting in isolation as well as in dyadic interactions. The purpose of the present experiment was to replicate and extend previous research by investigating whether IOR can be affected by an interaction with a member of the racial outgroup. Furthermore, the present experiment also investigated whether implicit racial prejudice could influence the magnitude of IOR. A total of 73 participants took part in the present experiment, which utilised facial electromyography to measure participants’ implicit racial attitudes, as well as a movement apparatus to measure reaction time as an index of inhibition of return. In line with previous research, reaction times were found to be significantly slower when participants responded to same targets compared to different targets, as well as for the other person condition compared to the self condition. Two novel predictions were also investigated in this experiment. The results indicated that response times were not affected by interacting with a different-race partner and implicit racial prejudice was not related to the magnitude of the between-person IOR effects. However, the magnitude of the within-person IOR effects was found to be affected by implicit racial prejudice for participants interacting with a different-race partner. Overall, the findings highlight the possibility that outgroup members are paid more attention than ingroup members, especially for more racially prejudiced individuals. Implications for anti-prejudice interventions are discussed.},

  abstract    = {Previous evidence suggests that directional social cues (e.g., eye gaze) cause automatic shifts in attention toward gaze direction. It has been proposed that automatic attentional orienting driven by social cues (social orienting) involves a different neural network from automatic orienting driven by nonsocial cues. However, previous neuroimaging studies on social orienting have only compared gaze cues to symbolic cues, which typically engage top-down mechanisms. Therefore, we directly compared the neural activity involved in social orienting to that involved in purely automatic nonsocial orienting. Twenty participants performed a spatial cueing task consisting of social (gaze) cues and automatic nonsocial (peripheral squares) cues presented at short and long stimulus (cue-to-target) onset asynchronies (SOA), while undergoing fMRI. Behaviorally, a facilitation effect was found for both cue types at the short SOA, while an inhibitory effect (inhibition of return: IOR) was found only for nonsocial cues at the long SOA. Imaging results demonstrated that social and nonsocial cues recruited a largely overlapping fronto-parietal network. In addition, social cueing evoked greater activity in occipito-temporal regions at both SOAs, while nonsocial cueing recruited greater subcortical activity, but only for the long SOA (when IOR was found). A control experiment, including central arrow cues, confirmed that the occipito-temporal activity was at least in part due to the social nature of the cue and not simply to the location of presentation (central vs. peripheral). These results suggest an evolutionary trajectory for automatic orienting, from predominantly subcortical mechanisms for nonsocial orienting to predominantly cortical mechanisms for social orienting.},

In the experiment reported here, we manipulated the congruency of movement intentions and action intentions in a pair of jointly acting individuals (i.e., a participant paired with a confederate coactor) and investigated how congruency influenced performance. Overall, participants initiated actions faster when they had the same action intention as the coactor (i.e., when participants and the coactor were pursuing the same conceptual goal). Participants' responses were also faster when their and the coactor's movement intentions were directed to the same spatial location, but only when participants had the same action intention as the coactor. These findings suggest that observers use the same representation to implement their own action intentions that they use to infer other people's action intentions and also that a dynamic, multitiered intentional mechanism is involved in the processing of other people's actions.},

Previous studies have examined the influence of the goal of the action on sIOR. In these studies, however, the movement endpoint and to-be-attained goal (e.g., touching/pressing a response key) were at the same spatial location. In the present two experiments, we disentangled movement endpoint and goal's identity and locations by means of introducing action effects that followed directly from a movement. Similar methods were previously shown powerful enough to clearly show the importance of action goals for other phenomena – a finding consistent with effect-based theories of action control, such as the ideomotor theory. The results of the present study revealed that sIOR was shaped by the movement endpoint location, not the goal's identity or location. That is, in both experiments, an sIOR effect was observed, but the magnitude of the sIOR effect was not modulated by repetitions/switches of goals or rather their locations. Thus, results indicate that goals play a negligible role in the emergence of the sIOR and, consequently, highlight the importance of action observation for the emergence of the sIOR effect.},

Simultaneously with or 900 ms before target presentation, one face with averted gaze switched to direct gaze, and one face with direct gaze switched to averted gaze. When gaze transitions and target presentation were simultaneous, the greatest response-time facilitation occurred at the location of the sudden onset of direct gaze. When target presentation was delayed, direct-gaze cues maintained a facilitatory influence, whereas motion cues induced an inhibitory influence. These findings reveal that gaze cues and motion cues at the same location influence information processing via independent and concurrently acting social and nonsocial attention channels.},

The present research was conducted to investigate how the processing of visual stimuli may be affected by the presence and the hand posture of a co-actor. Experiments conducted with participants acting alone have revealed that the distance from the stimulus to the hand of a participant can alter visual processing. In the main experiment of the present paper, we asked whether this posture-related source of visual bias persists when participants share the task with another person. The effect of personal and co-actor hand-proximity on visual processing was assessed through object-specific benefits to visual recognition in a task performed by two co-actors. Pairs of participants completed a joint visual recognition task and, across different blocks of trials, the position of their own hands and of their partner's hands varied relative to the stimuli. In contrast to control studies conducted with participants acting alone, an object-specific recognition benefit was found across all hand location conditions. These data suggest that visual processing is, in some cases, sensitive to the posture of a co-actor.},

  abstract    = {Social attention refers to the ability, which generally characterizes human beings as well as other animal species, to orient attentional resources in response to spatial cues provided by other individuals. These spatial cues are typically represented by gaze direction, head direction, and body orientation. This thesis focused mainly on the role that some social variables play in modulating this ability.
In Chapter 1, the concept of social attention and its relevance in regulating social interactions are discussed. After that, in Chapter 2, I present four studies in which I have employed the gaze-cueing paradigm. This allows to investigate the role of gaze direction in modulating social attention. In these four studies, the social variables manipulated have been social status (Study 1) and political affiliation (Study 2). Moreover, I have also investigated the impact of implicit social learning on gaze cueing (Study 3). The final study (Study 4), investigated social attention in schizophrenic patients, who are known to be particularly impaired in dealing with social stimuli. In Chapter 3, I present a particular aspect of social attention known as social inhibition of return, a phenomenon whereby an individual is slower to reach a location previously explorer by another individual. Here, I have manipulated the social similarity between participants (Study 5). Finally, in Chapter 4, I present some evidence supporting the view that gaze direction, in combination with racial group membership, represents a crucial variable not only for attentional mechanisms but even for the encoding and maintenance of face’s visual representations in visual working memory (Study 6). To conclude, in Chapter 5, a general discussion highlights the importance of considering social variables in the study of social attention, inviting to embrace a more ecological research approach in order to investigate this phenomenon during real social interactions and in real world settings.},

  abstract    = {When attention is oriented to a peripheral cue, the processing of nearby stimuli is facilitated. This brief period of facilitation is followed by a long-lasting inhibitory effect, during which there is a delayed response to stimuli presented at a previously cued location. Although the mechanisms underlying the facilitatory effect of attentional orienting/reorienting in three-dimensional (3-D) space have been documented, there is not yet consensus as to how attention orients/reorients in depth during the later inhibitory phase (i.e., inhibition of return [IOR]). In the present study, by incorporating the Posner exogenous cueing paradigm into a virtual 3-D environment, we aimed to investigate whether an IOR effect occurs when attention orients and reorients at the uncued depth in the same hemispace, and whether the IOR effects are the same or different when attention orients/reorients along different trajectories in 3-D space. Our results showed asymmetrical spatial IOR effects when attention was oriented/reoriented at the uncued depth in the same hemispace. Spatial IOR was depth-specific when targets appeared in the near depth plane, whereas it was not depth-specific when targets appeared in the far depth plane. Apart from these results, we also found that attention oriented/reoriented at the same depth but in a different hemispace experienced a reduction in IOR size, thus indicating that the direction-specific spatial IOR mechanisms when attention orients/reorients along different trajectories are different. Taken together, our results suggest that spatial IOR is not entirely ``depth-blind,'' and that the ecological importance of the 3-D world influences the direction of attentional shifts of spatial IOR in 3-D space.},

Since its discovery, scores of papers have been published on IOR, and researchers have proposed, accepted and rejected a variety of potential causes, mechanisms, effects and components for the phenomenon. Experts in IOR were surveyed about their opinions regarding various aspects of IOR and the literature exploring it. We found variety both between and within experts surveyed, suggesting that most researchers hold implicit, and often quite unique assumptions about IOR. These widely varied assumptions may be hindering the creation or acceptance of a central theoretical framework regarding IOR; and this variety may portend that what has been given the label ``IOR'' may be more than one phenomenon requiring more than one theoretical explanation. We wonder whether scientific progress in domains other than IOR might be affected by too broad (or perhaps too narrow) a range of phenomena to which our nomenclature is applied.},

Healthy individuals (Experiment 1) and individuals with AN (Experiment 2) completed a task with another person which consisted in performing, alternatively, rapid aiming movements to lateralised targets. Generally, this task leads to a form of Inhibition of Return (IOR), which consists of longer reaction times when an individual has to respond to a location previously searched by either himself (individual IOR) or by the partner (social IOR) as compared to previously unexplored locations. IOR is considered as an important attentional mechanism that promotes an effective exploration of the environment during social interaction. Here, healthy individuals displayed both individual and social IOR that were both reliable and of the same magnitude. Individuals with AN displayed a non-significant individual IOR but a reliable social IOR that was also significantly stronger than individual IOR. These results suggest the presence of a reduced sensitivity in processing body-related stimuli conveyed by oneself in individuals with AN which is reflected in action-based attentional processes.},

  abstract    = {In this thesis I investigated whether and to what extent performing a task with another person may change individual cognitive performance. Interference paradigms are particularly suitable for addressing this issue. The rationale behind the use of these paradigms is that most of them can be split in two complementary or independent tasks assigned to two different individuals. By comparing task performance when participants act in the joint context and when they perform the task individually, important information may be derived about whether the co-actor's task is represented and how this representation influences one's own performance. Following this approach, I adopted the joint version of two different and well-known paradigms: the picture-word interference paradigm (Study 1: Experiments 1, 2, 3) and the Simon task (Study 2: Experiments 4, 5, 6). Both paradigms allow understanding how people can deal with the task irrelevant information when the accomplishment of the task is achieved in a joint (and cooperative) context. The results of both studies provided converging evidence showing that, regardless of the paradigm used, task sharing determines the disappearance of the interference effect produced by the task irrelevant information (Study 1) or by the (incidental) spatial representation of an alternative response (Study 2). The disappearance of the interference effects, however, occurred only when the co-actor was thought to work on different or complementary stimuli but not when s/he was in charge of the same stimuli as the participant. These findings will be accounted for by taking into consideration both the specific peculiarities of each paradigm exploited and the strategic processes of division of labor that can be established between two co-acting individuals.},

Search was slower than in typical IOR paradigms, taking seconds instead of a few hundred milliseconds. Participants also made a speeded response when they detected a flashing leaf that either was or was not in a previously searched location. Responses were slower when the flashing leaf was in a previously searched location than when it was in an unvisited location. These results generalize IOR to an approximation of a naturalistic visual search setting and support the hypothesis that IOR can facilitate foraging. The experiment also constitutes the first use of a fully immersive virtual reality display in the study of IOR.},

Producing realistic-looking facial animations that are able to transmit this degree of complexity continues to be a challenging research topic in computer graphics. One important question that remains to be answered is: When are facial animations good enough? Here we present an integrated framework in which psychophysical experiments are used in a first step to systematically evaluate the perceptual quality of several different computer-generated animations with respect to real-world video sequences. The first experiment provides an evaluation of several animation techniques, exposing specific animation parameters that are important to achieve perceptual fidelity. In a second experiment, we then use these benchmarked animation techniques in the context of perceptual research in order to systematically investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of expressions. A third and final experiment uses the quality measures that were developed in the first two experiments to examine the perceptual impact of changing facial features to improve the animation techniques. Using such an integrated approach, we are able to provide important insights into facial expressions for both the perceptual and computer graphics community.},

Recent studies have also begun to suggest that JA affects adult cognition as well, but methodological limitations hamper research on this topic. To address this issue we developed a novel virtual reality paradigm that integrates eye-tracking and virtual avatar technology to measure two types of JA in adults, Initiating Joint Attention (IJA) and Responding to Joint Attention (RJA). Distinguishing these types of JA in research is important because they are thought to reflect unique, as well as common constellations of processes involved in human social-cognition and social learning. We tested the validity of the differentiation of IJA and RJA in our paradigm in two studies of picture recognition memory in undergraduate students. Study 1 indicated that young adults correctly identified more pictures they had previously viewed in an IJA condition (67%) than in a RJA (58%) condition, η2 = 0.57. Study 2 controlled for IJA and RJA stimulus viewing time differences, and replicated the findings of Study 1. The implications of these results for the validity of the paradigm and research on the affects of JA on adult social-cognition are discussed.},

To address this question, we applied a common paradigm to a joint Simon task (Experiments 1 and 4), a standard Simon task (Experiment 2), and a go/no-go task (Experiment 3). The results showed that both the JSE and the SE were modulated by the repetition/non-repetition of task features. Moreover, the JSE was differently modulated by the gender composition of the two individuals involved in the shared task and by their interpersonal relationship. Taken together, our results do not support a pure social explanation of the JSE, nevertheless, they show the independent role of different social factors in modulating the effect.},

This phenomenon, termed inhibition of return (IOR), has most often been studied with participants responding to stimuli on their own (individual or iIOR). More recently IOR has also been found when a participant observes the response of another individual immediately before responding themselves (social or sIOR). The present study aimed to determine if sIOR occurs when participants perform different actions in response to shared target stimuli. Participants sat opposite each other and responded to the same stimuli, but performed different actions in response to the targets – one performed aiming movements, one performed key presses. Using spectacles with liquid crystal lenses, vision of a partner’s action was manipulated such that in the Restricted Vision condition the stimulus onset and end-point of a partner’s action were not seen. In the Full Vision condition, stimulus onset and the partner’s entire response was visible to the observer prior to their own action. As expected, sIOR was seen in all Full Vision conditions. Of greater theoretical interest, sIOR did not emerge in the Restricted Vision condition when participants observed an action different from their own immediately before responding. The present results suggest that, in sIOR paradigms, viewing different actions to one’s own fail to generate the attentional shift necessary to activate the mechanisms driving the sIOR effect.},

  abstract    = {The present thesis was dedicated to examining individuals’ performance on a low-level reaching task conducted under social-interactive conditions. In this paradigm named Social Inhibition of Return (social IOR) two individuals, sitting opposite each other take turns to respond to targets appearing on either side of a visual display. Typical results reveal that reaction times are longer when responses are directed to where the co-actor just responded. Despite being fairly simple, this task is intriguing to examine as it potentially incorporates features of both an inhibition of return (IOR) effect and, a joint-action phenomenon, due to its interactive nature. Indeed, the results of the standard social IOR paradigm where participants sit opposite are consistent with both explanations as the potential involvement of attentional inhibition and/or action co-representation cannot be disentangled. The present work examined the causes and properties of this intriguing effect over the course of four empirical chapters. First, Chapter 2 revealed that social IOR possesses a number of properties, characteristic of traditional IOR. Second, Chapter 3 convincingly demonstrated that action co-representation does not seem to contribute to the phenomenon. Furthermore, Chapter 4 confirmed these findings by revealing that social IOR does not depend on the socialness of the co-actor. Finally, Chapter 5 showed that it could even bias a range of free choice decisions which revealed another novel property of the effect. Taken together these findings were interpreted as mostly consistent with a low-level inhibitory account as opposed to a theory, advocating an involvement of action imitation/co-representation in the effect. The present work had a number of theoretical and methodological implications for the better understanding of social IOR. In more general terms, it also contributed to the quickly developing, alternative literature to the action co-representation account, advocating a bottom-up basis of some joint-action effects.},

  abstract    = {This thesis reports a series of studies investigating the relationship between empathy and the mirror neuron system through the observation of simple actions that are devoid of emotion. Prior research has suggested that such a relationship exists, but also has hinted that it is more complex due to the different types of empathy that may exist. Specifically, this thesis examines cognitive (perspective taking) and emotional (the emotional response) empathy and their link to the execution and observation of simple actions in the absence of emotional effectors. It provides original contributions to knowledge with a new proposal of how empathy may drive the mirror neuron system and the mentalizing system (two theoretical neural networks) to interact, and a proposal that equally high levels of cognitive and emotional empathy may cause cognitive strain. It also provides the first investigation of the neural processes of the two-person social inhibition of return task (a task investigating the delay in returning to a location previously visited by oneself or another individual), and delves into the issue of state empathy (an aroused emotional reaction to perception of another’s state) superseding trait empathy (the inherent ability to experience empathy).

    After an introduction in Chapter 1 to the main areas of interest relevant to the thesis, Chapter 2 reports an experiment that investigated the relationship between cognitive empathy and simple motor activity. EEG activity was recorded over the motor area while participants observed and performed simple actions demonstrated by a model. Analyses revealed significant suppression in mu/alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (18-22 Hz) EEG bands, indicative of sensorimotor activity, during both observed and executed actions. Crucially, participants rating higher in perspective taking as a measure of trait cognitive empathy showed significantly less beta suppression when observing actions. The direction of this relationship, contrary to studies involving induced emotional empathy, may reflect individual differences in mentalizing and mirroring mechanisms to understand others’ actions. I suggest that at the unconscious level it is primarily the mirror neuron system that controls such automatic behaviour, regardless of how great the capacity an individual’s cognitive empathy may be. In contrast, when it comes to deliberate, controlled actions, it appears that greater cognitive effort is required and the mentalizing system plays a greater role.

    Chapter 3 followed up a key question that arose from Chapter 2: Could I demonstrate the cognitive difference in employing the mirror versus the mentalizing systems? Based on the results reported in Chapter 2, because those higher in perspective taking hypothetically employ greater cognitive efforts than those lower in the trait, they would be well practiced in using more cognition. Therefore, due to the extra effort required in an initial cognitive task, those lower in perspective taking would be expected to show more cognitive impairment in a subsequent cognitively demanding task. The two studies reported in this chapter did not satisfactorily resolve this question. The attempt to manipulate state empathy through similarity, however, produced an interesting interaction between perspective taking and empathic concern. As expected, when participants felt similar to the woman in the first task’s videos and had low emotional empathy, those high in cognitive empathy performed better in the second task--a Stroop task--than those low in cognitive empathy. However, this pattern was reversed for participants high in emotional empathy with those low in cognitive empathy outperforming those high in the trait. These results suggest that the higher level of emotional empathy, possibly enhanced by the similarity condition, conflicts  with and overrides the influence of cognitive empathy and that perhaps people work optimally with either dominant emotional empathy or dominant cognitive empathy, but less so with high or low levels of both.

    Chapter 4 investigated further a second question raised by the study in Chapter 2: Would the results be affected by interaction with a second person? This study involved recording event-related potentials while two participants executed and observed simple actions together. The task used was a coordinated button pressing task measuring an effect known as inhibition of return (IOR). Results were consistent with other studies in demonstrating the IOR effect, behaviourally and neurally. Empathy was found to moderate some relationships in the fronto-central P2 and parietal P3 ERP components. Interactions in the P2 component showed that those low in empathic concern had less activity when they were currently executing a trial and had previously observed a trial. The unusual situation between the two participants created by the strange setup with the EEG caps appeared to enhance levels of state empathy for each other. One would expect that those naturally higher in emotional trait empathy would feel this to a greater extent, thus increasing their focus on the other person’s turns, compared to those lower in the trait. The other finding for empathy indicated that those lower in perspective taking had less activity in the P3 component when the previous trial had been observed compared to executed, whereas there was no difference for those higher in perspective taking. I attributed this to the diminished amount of empathy with the other person in those with lower cognitive empathy, thus rendering them less affected by the other’s actions and more interested in their own.

    With some novel new findings, the studies in this thesis have demonstrated the complexity of empathy as it relates to the brain and behaviour for the execution and observation of simple actions in the absence of emotional effectors.},

This study provides evidence for an equivalent allocentric mechanism that allows passive observers to selectively attend to information from the perspective of another person. In a negative priming task, participants reached for a red target stimulus whilst ignoring a green distractor. Distractors located close to their hand were inhibited strongly, consistent with an egocentric frame of reference. When participants took turns with another person, the pattern of negative priming shifted to an allocentric frame of reference: locations close to the hand of the observed agent (but far away from the participant’s hand) were inhibited strongly. This suggests that witnessing another’s action leads the observer to simulate the same selective attention mechanisms such that they effectively perceive their surroundings from the other person’s perspective. },

Pairs of participants moved their “avatars” along an invisible virtual line and could make haptic contact with three identical objects, two of which embodied the other's motions, but only one, the other's avatar, also embodied the other's contact sensor and thereby enabled responsive interaction. Co-regulated interactions were significantly correlated with identifications of the other's avatar and reports of the clearest awareness of the other's presence. These results challenge folk psychological notions about the boundaries of mind, but make sense from evolutionary and developmental perspectives: an extendible mind can offload cognitive work into its environment.},

  abstract    = {Executive control refers to the ability to withstand interference in order to achieve task goals. The effect of conflict adaptation describes that after experiencing interference, subsequent conflict effects are weaker. However, changes in the source of conflict have been found to disrupt conflict adaptation. Previous studies indicated that this specificity is determined by the degree to which one source causes episodic retrieval of a previous source. A virtual reality version of the Simon task was employed to investigate whether changes in a visual representation of the self would similarly affect conflict adaptation. Participants engaged in a mediated Simon task via 3D "avatar" models that either mirrored the participants' movements, or were presented statically. A retrieval cue was implemented as the identity of the avatar: switching it from a male to a female avatar was expected to disrupt the conflict adaptation effect (CAE). The results show that only in static conditions did the CAE depend on the avatar identity, while in dynamic conditions, changes did not cause disruption. We also explored the effect of conflict and adaptation on the degree of movement made with the task-irrelevant hand and replicated the reaction time pattern. The findings add to earlier studies of source-specific conflict adaptation by showing that a visual representation of the self in action can provide a cue that determines episodic retrieval. Furthermore, the novel paradigm is made openly available to the scientific community and is described in its significance for studies of social cognition, cognitive psychology, and human-computer interaction.},

  abstract    = {With technology being advanced and many new teaching methods being implemented, considering virtual worlds for teaching is quite innovative and interesting. A virtual environment is an artificially constructed  representation of a natural or imagined environment. Virtual worlds consist of enactment for terrains, avatars, objects, textures, and other forms of digital assets. Many virtual worlds like Alpha World, Delta 3D, Second Life etc. are available today. An avatar can be defined as a computer user’s representation of him/her-self within the virtual environment.       Today, educational institutes have been using virtual worlds in various fields like designing user interfaces, nursing courses,  cooperate training, leadership training programmes. But certain aspects need to be examined thoroughly like how virtual spaces are influencing education, how students and teachers understand learning in virtual worlds while interacting through avatars where communication lacks body language and is limited to seeing, hearing and talking. Our study was conducted on a single course called Business Talking offered in Second Life by Linnaeus University.This course mainly emphasizes on technical and administrative presentations in English.        The main purpose of our study is to investigate how students and teachers understand learning in such environments and identifying the factors which are related to this. Relating to the purpose the research question “How do students and teachers perceive learning through avatar-based interaction in virtual world environments? ”  was investigated.     Pedagogy and general theories like constructivism, cognition, virtual world, synchronous versus asynchronous e-learning were used in our study.     A qualitative interpretative case study was conducted. Data was collected through observations and interviews. All the sessions of the course were observed and  interviews were made with five students and one teacher of the course.     The main results include students perceive more through avatar education as they get a sense of real feeling when compared  to other online education systems. Also, performing activities in different places of SL such as camp fire, near waterfalls, different cultural places etc. made them perceive well as they feel relaxed and less pressure. Second Life's environment helps to simulate real conditions and situations which help them to perceive more. But factors like usability of avatars, technical problems and getting adapted to the environment play an unfavourable role in perceiving learning.  Both the teachers and students have to be constructive and good pedagogical decisions have to be made when a problem arises. Another main result was that, lack of body language does effect in perceiving learning.},
